## I. Project Overview üí™
Fitness Macro Calculator System is a Python-based application designed to assist users in calculating their daily caloric needs and macronutrient distribution based on their personal fitness goals. The system also provides a customized weekly workout schedule. Users can input their personal details like name, age, weight, height, and activity level to receive precise caloric recommendations tailored to their dietary phase: Maintenance, Cutting, or Bulking.

This program aims to make fitness planning more accessible by offering an intuitive user interface where users can seamlessly navigate between screens, view personalized macronutrient breakdowns, and follow structured workout routines. The system integrates both nutritional and workout guidance in one easy-to-use application.

## II. Python Concepts, Libraries, and Features üêç
In developing this Fitness Macro Calculator and Workout Scheduler, several Python concepts and libraries were utilized to ensure efficient functionality and scalability, including:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
The project applies key Object-Oriented Programming principles for better structure and maintainability:
- **Encapsulation**
   - In this system, user data (age, weight, height, gender) is stored in the user_data dictionary, and calculations are handled via dedicated functions like calculate_bmr(), calculate_tdee(), and calculate_macronutrients().
The main UI elements and logic are encapsulated within the Tkinter frames and functions that control screen transitions and user interactions.

- **Inheritance**
   - For instance, the classes ttk.Combobox, ttk.Button, and ttk.Label inherit from base Tkinter classes, and they are extended with specific functionality such as button clicks and screen transitions.

- **Polymorphism**
   - Methods like show_day_workout() dynamically update the workout plan based on the selected day (Monday, Tuesday, etc.).
   - The show_result_screen() and show_workout_schedule() functions use polymorphism to manage different types of screens and their respective data, ensuring the right information is shown to the user at each stage.

- **Abstraction**
   - The calculations for BMR, TDEE, and macronutrient distribution are abstracted into functions, simplifying the user experience by not requiring them to understand the underlying math.
   - The detailed workout plans for each day are stored as dictionary entries, and users only need to interact with the buttons without worrying about the data structure.

2. **GUI with Tkinter**
   - The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using Tkinter to create an interactive and dynamic user experience:
     - Multiple screens (Main, Activity Level, Phase, Results, Workout Schedule) are implemented using tk.Frame, which is switched dynamically using .pack_forget() and .pack().
     - The interface contains user input fields for name, age, weight, height, gender, activity level, and dietary phase.
     - Buttons and dropdown menus (ttk.Combobox) are used to navigate between screens and make selections.
     - Text information and results are displayed dynamically using tk.Label and tk.StringVar().

3. **Data Validation and Error Handling**
   - To ensure users provide complete and valid information before proceeding, the following validation checks are implemented:
     - Required fields: If any input field is missing (such as name, age, weight, or height), the program will show a pop-up error: "Please fill out all the information!"
     - Numeric validation: If age, weight, or height are not numeric, an error message is shown: "Age, Weight, and Height must be numeric values!"
     - Activity and phase validation: If the user does not select an activity level or dietary phase, they are prompted with a message like: "Please select an activity level!" or "Please select a dietary phase!"
     - These checks prevent incomplete or invalid data from being processed and ensure smooth user interaction.

4. **Calculations**
   - The system performs essential calculations based on user input:
     - BMR Calculation: The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is calculated based on the Mifflin-St Jeor equation for both males and females.
     - TDEE Calculation: The Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is calculated by applying an activity factor based on the user‚Äôs selected activity level.
     - Macronutrient Calculation: The macronutrient distribution (protein, fats, and carbohydrates) is calculated according to the selected dietary phase (maintenance, cutting, bulking).

5. **Workout Schedule**
   - The system also provides a personalized workout schedule for each day of the week. The workout routine is displayed dynamically when the user clicks on a day:
     - Workouts include exercises for muscle groups such as chest, triceps, biceps, back, shoulders, legs, and cardio.
     - The user can view the workout plan for each day and switch between different days by clicking the corresponding buttons (Monday, Tuesday, etc.).
     - The workout plans are predefined in a dictionary and displayed using tk.Label.

6. **Libraries Used**
   - tkinter: The core library for building the GUI, handling user interactions, and managing different screens.
   - ttk: For additional styling of widgets like buttons and comboboxes.
   - messagebox: For displaying pop-up messages and alerts for user notifications and error handling.
  
7. **Database Integration with SQLite**
   - SQLite is integrated to store user data persistently:
     - sqlite3.connect("fitness_app.db") establishes a connection to the SQLite database.
     - cursor.execute runs SQL commands like CREATE TABLE and INSERT INTO.
     - save_to_db() inserts user data and calculated results into the database, enabling future retrieval or analysis.
    
8. **Data Persistence & Update Handling**
   - The system allows users to update certain fields (age, weight, height) while keeping others locked (name, gender, activity level, phase):
     - Pre-filled Fields: update_user_data() reopens the main screen with pre-filled data while locking name and gender fields, preserving integrity.
     - Reset Functionality: reset_all_fields() clears all inputs and resets the program to its initial state.
